# 循环依赖

循环依赖指的是两个或多个 Bean 之间相互持有对方的依赖,形成依赖环。

## 循环依赖类型

1. 构造器循环依赖:

Error creating bean with name 'constructorA': Requested bean is currently in creation: 
Is there an unresolvable circular reference?
[ConstructorTest.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fspring%2Fcircular%2Fconstructor%2FConstructorTest.java)


2. Setter 循环依赖(支持):

[SetterTest.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fspring%2Fcircular%2Fsetter%2FSetterTest.java)

3. 字段注入循环依赖:

StackOverflowError异常，本质上是一个递归调用的过程，当调用到一定深度的时候，就会抛出异常。
[FieldTest.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fspring%2Fcircular%2Ffield%2FFieldTest.java)

4. 多例 Bean 循环依赖：

Requested bean is currently in creation: Is there an unresolvable circular reference
[PrototypeTest.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fspring%2Fcircular%2Fprototype%2FPrototypeTest.java)

5. 代理对象循环依赖
```java
Exception in thread "main" org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCurrentlyInCreationException:
Error creating bean with name 'proxyA': Bean with name 'proxyA' 
has been injected into other beans [proxyB] in its raw version as part of a circular reference, 
but has eventually been wrapped. This means that said other beans do not use the 
final version of the bean. This is often the result of over-eager type matching - 
consider using 'getBeanNamesForType' with the 'allowEagerInit' flag turned off, for example.
```
[ProxyTest.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fspring%2Fcircular%2Fproxy%2FProxyTest.java)
